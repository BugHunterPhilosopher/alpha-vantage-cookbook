### _if for example I make a request for MSFT and 5min bars, do the he timestamps on the intraday data represent the end time or the begin time of the bar?_

The timestamp mentioned indicates the end time or the last refreshed time for the details mentioned within the block. On the other hand for the first bar time stamp is 09:30:00  which indicates prices between 09:25:00 to 09:30:00.
