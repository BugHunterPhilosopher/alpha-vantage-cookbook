# Symbol Search

See this post:

https://www.alpha-vantage.community/post/symbol-search-api-9609292?pid=1302943198


There are multiple aspects to this topic

* Enter symbol, get company name and/or details
* Enter company name, get symbols
* Determine symbol naming format that works with Alpha Vantage
* Determine that data that Alpha Vantage is likely to return for a symbol
* And so on

The following is a preliminary investigation into online symbol search API with data available - just like Alpha Vantage - at no charge
